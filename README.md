# Create a cryptographic algorithm using C 

This is where I built a simple math based algorithm where you can encrypt your string message into a hashing values something like SHA256/ Keccak 


## SetUp - for Contribution

I am using bashbs [build system created by dr jonas birch] try that out over
https://repo.doctorbirch.com

if you are not using that just create a Makefile conf and there you go!


I have created a notion doc where I have created a mindmap of how to create something like this 

check this plz

### Some Talk

I have a npm package called "felixhash" over there I have tried to do the same (~) in typescript you can check that out obviously.
https://github.com/felixoder/cryptohash [give me a star]

and one thing creating something exactly like SHA256, Keccak256 is a huge job anit will be hard to do. the algorithm I have tried to create is not 100% of SHA algo but I have tried to create something like that.

## Testing

```bash
./SHA
Enter the value: Debayan
SHA-256 Hash: fdb98f407aae8d9e258a4cc4270bbd58601facefc6807235df45eab627da0998
➜  SHA git:(master) ✗ ./SHA
Enter the value: debayan
```
